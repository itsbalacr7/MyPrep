-- Step 1: Get the most recent review date for each project
WITH MostRecentReviewDate AS (
  SELECT 
    project_id,
    MAX(review_date) AS latest_review
  FROM Performance
  GROUP BY project_id
),

-- Step 2: Get performance entries that occurred on the latest review date
LatestProjectReviews AS (
  SELECT 
    perf.project_id,
    perf.employee_id,
    perf.score,
    perf.review_date
  FROM Performance perf
  JOIN MostRecentReviewDate mr
    ON perf.project_id = mr.project_id 
   AND perf.review_date = mr.latest_review
),

-- Step 3: Assign ranks to employees based on their scores per project
RankedTopPerformers AS (
  SELECT 
    reviews.project_id,
    reviews.employee_id,
    emp.name,
    reviews.score,
    reviews.review_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY reviews.project_id 
      ORDER BY reviews.score DESC
    ) AS performance_rank
  FROM LatestProjectReviews reviews
  JOIN Employees emp 
    ON reviews.employee_id = emp.employee_id
)

-- Step 4: Return top 2 ranked employees per project (including ties)
SELECT 
  project_id,
  employee_id,
  name,
  score,
  review_date
FROM RankedTopPerformers
WHERE performance_rank <= 2
ORDER BY project_id, performance_rank, employee_id;
